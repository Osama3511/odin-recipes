        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A corn dog is a sausage (usually a hot dog) that has been skewered, coated in a cornmeal batter, and deep-fried. A staple of American cuisine, the street food was likely invented by German immigrants in Texas in the 1920s.</p>

        <h3>ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
            <li><strong>Cornmeal</strong> and <strong>flour:</strong> This corn dog batter starts with yellow cornmeal and all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>A pinch of sugar lends a hint of sweetness.</li>
            <li><strong>Baking powder:</strong> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the batter rise.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong> and <strong>pepper:</strong> Salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients</li>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> A cup of milk adds moisture, ensuring a tender coating.</li>
            <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg gives the batter even more moisture and acts as a binder, which means it helps hold the batter together.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil:</strong>Fry the corn dogs in a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as vegetable oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Beef frankfurters:</strong>This recipe calls for beef frankfurters, but you can use pork franks (or hot dogs) if you'd prefer.</li>
            </ul>
